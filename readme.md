# PDF Merger and Watermarker

This is a Python script that allows you to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF and add a watermark to the merged PDF.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyPDF2 library (`pip install PyPDF2`)

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `pdf_merger_watermarker.py` script.

2. Place the PDF files you want to merge into the same directory as the script.

3. Optionally, add the watermark file (a PDF with a transparent background) into the same directory if you want to apply a watermark.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the script and the PDF files.

5. Run the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python pdf_merger_watermarker.py
